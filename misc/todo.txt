basic operation:
    get number to factor.
    divide by (x) and if modulo = 1, then not factor.
funcs:
    main, GetNum, FactorNum

   (not needed, c++ has standard uint main should include a typedef for unsigned int.

    FactorNumber should include a for loop,

    the for loop should divide a number by another number
    ·with all possible combinations.

    the for loop should use modulo % to check remainder.
    ·if the remainder is one, throw away that number
    °and continue.
optional:
    use command line arguments to factor a negative number.
    ·I am currently using an unsigned int (a non-negative number,
    °because the process to factor a negative number is different
    °than to factor a non-negative number.
